### Built With

* React (TypeScript)
* JavaScript
* Next.js
* Material-UI
* CSS
* @testing-library/react for React testing
* Python
* FastAPI
* fastapi.testclient for FastAPI testing

### Running test cases

To run the test cases, execute the following command in the root directory:
* For backend testing (using pytest)
```sh 
pytest
```

* For React testing (using npm):
```sh
npm test
```

### Pointers taken into consideration while building the application

* Dummy data has been used wherever necessary
* Utilizing a Data Transfer Object (DTO) or employing GraphQL proves beneficial for optimizing queries, especially in scenarios involving substantial data sets where only specific portions of data need to be retrieved or operated upon
